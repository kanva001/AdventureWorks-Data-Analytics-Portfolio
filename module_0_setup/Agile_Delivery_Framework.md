# Agile Delivery Framework
## AdventureWorks Inventory Accuracy & ICQA Analytics Program

## Purpose
The program is delivered using an Agile, sprint-based model to provide incremental
operational insights, reduce delivery risk, and ensure analytical outputs meet
enterprise standards for accuracy, auditability, and performance.

This framework reflects Agile execution used by large-scale e-commerce organizations
supporting inventory control and fulfillment operations.

## Sprint Cadence
- Sprint length: 2 weeks (conceptual)
- Each sprint ends with a formal release
- Deliverables are production-ready at sprint close

## Definition of Done (DoD)
A sprint is complete only when:
- Business questions are answered
- KPI definitions and assumptions are documented
- Smoke and functional tests pass
- Outputs are reproducible and validated
- Artifacts are committed to version control
- Sprint Release Notes are published

## Spike Stories
Spike stories are time-boxed investigations used to reduce uncertainty before delivery.
Spikes produce decisions and documentation, not production code.

## Release Management
Each sprint concludes with:
- Sprint Release Notes
- Test evidence (smoke + functional)
- Documented risks and follow-ups
- Handoff to the next sprint
